 resilient and universal as the markup you write.
 It shines as bright and as bold as the forward-thinking,
 dedicated web developers you are. Its the standards standard, 
 a pennant for progress. And it certainly doesnt use tables for layout.</br>

HTML Images Syntax<br/>
In HTML, images are defined with the img tag. 
The img tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag. 
The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image: 
Ideally, you should start your learning journey by learning HTML.<br/>
Start by reading Introduction to HTML. You may then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:<br/><br/>

CSS, and how to use it to style HTML (for example alter your text size and fonts used, 
add borders and drop shadows, layout your page with multiple columns, add animations and other visual effects.)
JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages (for example find your location and plot it on a map,
make UI elements appear/disappear when you toggle a button, save users data locally on their computers, and much much more.)<br/><br/>

Before starting this topic, you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively 
(i.e. just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, 
and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files â€” both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete 
beginners module.<br/>

It is recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before attempting this topic, however,
it isnt absolutely necessary; much of what is covered in the HTML basics article is also covered in our Introduction to HTML module, 
albeit in a lot more detail.</p>
